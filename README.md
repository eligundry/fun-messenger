# Fun Messenger

My attempt at making an app with the Parcel Bundler, React, and Typescript

## Building

```sh
# Bring up the Docker Compose
$ docker-compose up
# Serve the JS dev server
$ npm run serve
# Build all the Docker containers
$ make containers
# Push the containers to Docker Hub
$ make publish
```
